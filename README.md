# Responsive-Portfolio-HS-H2
This is my portfolio generated with BootStrap elements to create a responsive design.

This site: https://hannahstarcevich.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio-HS-H2/
My GitHub: https://github.com/HannahStarcevich/Responsive-Portfolio-HS-H2

The intention of this project was to creat a responsive design web application. 

Elements used in this project: Bootstrap CSS Frameworks, responsive layout and images, grid systems

This website serves as the first fully developed version of my profile and portfolio. Porfolio elements will be featured and added once they are developed.
